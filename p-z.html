		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Presbyopia</h2>
		<p>Presbyopia is a vision condition in which the crystalline lens of your eye loses its flexibility, which makes it difficult for you to focus on close objects.
		</p>
		<p>Presbyopia may seem to occur suddenly, but the actual loss of flexibility takes place over a number of years. Presbyopia usually becomes noticeable in the early to mid-40s. Presbyopia is a natural part of the aging process of the eye. It is not a disease, and it cannot be prevented.</p>
		
		<p>Symptoms:</p>
		<p>
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
				<li>tendency to hold reading materials at arm’s length.</li>
				<li>blurred vision at normal reading distance.</li>
				<li>eye fatigue along with headaches when doing close work.</li>
			</ul>	
		</p>
		<p>How is Presbyopia treated?</p>
			<p>
				<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
					<li>Medications.</li>
					<li>reading glasses.</li>
					<li>bifocals.</li>
					<li>trifocals.</li>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Retinitis Pigmentosa</h2>
		<p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that damage the light-sensitive rods and cones located in the retina, the back part of our eyes. Rods, which provide side (peripheral) and night vision are affected more than the cones that provide color and clear central vision. </p>
		<p>Signs of RP usually appear during childhood or adolescence. The first sign is often night blindness followed by a slow loss of side vision. Over the years, the disease will cause further loss of side vision. As the disease develops, people with RP may often bump into chairs and other objects as side vision worsens and they only see in one direction – straight ahead. They see as if they are in a tunnel (thus the term tunnel vision).</p>
		<p>Currently, there is no cure for RP, but there is research that indicates that vitamin A and lutein may slow the rate at which the disease progresses. Your doctor of optometry can give you more specific information on nutritional supplements that may help you.

				Also, there are many new low vision aids, including telescopic and magnifying lenses, night vision scopes as well as other adaptive devices, that are available that help people maximize the vision that they have remaining. An optometrist, experienced in low vision rehabilitation, can provide these devices as well as advice about other training and assistance to help people remain independent and productive.

				Becuase it is an inherited disease, research into genetics may one day provide a prevention or cure for those who have RP.</p>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Spots and Floaters</h2>
		<p>Spots (often called floaters) are small, semi-transparent or cloudy specks or particles within the vitreous, which is the clear, jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of your eyes. They appear as specks of various shapes and sizes, threadlike strands or cobwebs. Because they are within your eyes, they move as your eyes move and seem to dart away when you try to look at them directly.</p>
		<p>Spots are often caused by small flecks of protein or other matter trapped during the formation of your eyes before birth. They can also result from deterioration of the vitreous fluid, due to aging; or from certain eye diseases or injuries.

			Most spots are not harmful and rarely limit vision. But, spots can be indications of more serious problems, and you should see your optometrist for a comprehensive examination when you notice sudden changes or see increases in them.

			looking in your eyes with special instruments, your optometrist can examine the health of your eyes and determine if what you are seeing is harmless or the symptom of a more serious problem that requires treatment.</p>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Visual Acuity: What is 20/20 Vision?</h2>
		<p>20/20 vision is a term used to express normal visual acuity (the clarity or sharpness of vision) measured at a distance of 20 feet. If you have 20/20 vision, you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. If you have 20/100 vision, it means that you must be as close as 20 feet to see what a person with normal vision can see at 100 feet.</p>
		<p>20/20 does not necessarily mean perfect vision. 20/20 vision only indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision at a distance. There are other important vision skills, including peripheral awareness or side vision, eye coordination, depth perception, focusing ability and color vision that contribute to your overall visual ability.

			Some people can see well at a distance, but are unable to bring nearer objects into focus. This condition can be caused by hyperopia (farsightedness) or presbyopia (loss of focusing ability). Others can see items that are close, but cannot see those far away. This condition may be caused by myopia (nearsightedness).

			A comprehensive eye examination by a doctor of optometry can diagnose those causes, if any, that are affecting your ability to see well. In most cases, your optometrist can prescribe glasses, contact lenses or a vision therapy program that will help improve your vision. If the reduced vision is due to an eye disease, the use of ocular medication or other treatment may be used.</p>
