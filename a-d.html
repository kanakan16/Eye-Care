		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Acanthamoeba</h2>
		<p>Acanthamoeba is one of the most ubiquitous organisms in the environment, but rarely causes infections.
		When infection does occur, however, it can be extremely serious and vision threatening. Recently, 
		there have been multiple reports of increasing incidence of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Co-infection with a 
		bacterial keratitis is common both in the contact lens case and on the cornea, complicating prevention,
		diagnosis and treatment.By educating yourself about the symptoms and risk factors for Acanthamoeba keratitis,
		you can help protect yourself from this potentially sight-threatening infection. The best defense against 
		Acanthamoeba keratitis infection is proper contact lens hygiene. See the Lens Care Guide for detailed contact
		lens care instructions.
		</p>
		<p>Symptoms:</p>
		<p>
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
				<li>A red, (frequently) painful eye infection—especially if the discomfort does notimprove with treatment.</li>
				<li>Foreign body sensation, tearing, light sensitivity, and blurred vision.</li>
				<li>Red, irritated eyes lasting for an unusually long period of time after removal of contact lenses.</li>
			</ul>	
		</p>
		<p>Risk Factors</p>
		<p>
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
				<li>Use of tap water in cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses—including the lens case.</li>
				<li>Swimming with contact lenses in the eyes, especially in fresh water lakes and rivers. Acanthamoeba keratitis has also been isolated from virtually all water sources—from pools to hot tubs to showers.</li>
				<li>Failure to follow lens care instructions (see Lens Care Guide below)/poor compliance.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Lens Care Guide</p>
		<p>
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
				<li>Always wash hands before handling contact lenses.</li>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Astigmatism</h2>
		<p>Astigmatism is a vision condition that causes blurred vision due either to the irregular shape of the cornea, the clear front cover of the eye, or sometimes the curvature of the lens inside the eye. An irregular shaped cornea or lens prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, the light sensitive surface at the back of the eye. As a result, vision becomes blurred at any distance.</p>
		<p> The specific cause of astigmatism is unknown. It can be hereditary and is usually present from birth. It can change as a child grows and may decrease or worsen over time.

			A comprehensive optometric examination will include testing for astigmatism. Depending on the amount present, your optometrist can provide eyeglasses or contact lenses that correct the astigmatism by altering the way light enters your eyes.

		</p>
		<p> Astigmatism is a very common vision condition. Most people have some degree of astigmatism. Slight amounts of astigmatism usually don’t affect vision and don’t require treatment. However, larger amounts cause distorted or blurred vision, eye discomfort and headaches.

			Astigmatism frequently occurs with other vision conditions like nearsightedness (myopia) and farsightedness (hyperopia). Together these vision conditions are referred to as refractive errors because they affect how the eyes bend or “refract” light.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another option for treating astigmatism uses a corneal modification procedure called orthokeratology (ortho-k). It is a painless, non-invasive procedure that involves wearing a series of specially designed rigid contact lenses to gradually reshape the curvature of the cornea.

			Laser surgery is also a possible treatment option for some types of astigmatism. It changes the shape of the cornea by removing a small amount of eye tissue. This is done using a highly focused laser beam on the surface of the eye.

				<li>Astigmatism occurs due to the irregular shape of the cornea or the lens inside the eye.</li>
				<li>The cornea and lens are primarily responsible for properly focusing light entering your eyes allowing you to see things clearly.</li>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Blepharitis</h2>
		<p>Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids causing red, irritated, itchy eyelids and the formation of dandruff-like scales on eyelashes. It is a common eye disorder caused by either bacterial or a skin condition such as dandruff of the scalp or acne rosacea. It affects people of all ages. Although uncomfortable, blepharitis is not contagious and generally does not cause any permanent damage to eyesight.</p>
		<p>What causes Blepharitis?</p>
			<p><ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
				<li>Anterior blepharitis is commonly caused by bacteria (staphylococcal blepharits) or

						Blepharitis can appear as greasy flakes or scales around the base of the eyelashes.
						Blepharitis can appear as greasy flakes or scales around the base of the eyelashes.

						dandruff of the scalp and eyebrows (seborrheic blepharitis).</li>
				<li>Posterior blepharitis can be caused by irregular oil production by the glands of the eyelids (meibomian blepharitis) which creates a favorable environment for bacterial growth.</li>
				
			</ul></p>
		<p>How is Blepharitis diagnosed?</p>
			<p>
				<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
					<li>External examination of the eye.</li>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Cataract</h2>
		<p>A cataract is a cloudy or opaque area in the normally clear lens of the eye. Depending upon its size and location, it can interfere with normal vision. Most cataracts develop in people over age 55, but they occasionally occur in infants and young children. Usually cataracts develop in both eyes, but one may be worse than the other. Reasearchers have linked eye-friendly nutrients such as lutein/zeaxanthin, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc to reducing the risk of certain eye diseases, including cataracts. For more information on the importance of good nutrition and eye health, please see the diet and nutrition section.</p>
		<p>The lens is located inside the eye behind the iris, the colored part of the eye. The lens focuses light on the back of the eye, the retina. The lens is made of mostly proteins and water. Clouding of the lens occurs due to changes in the proteins and lens fibers.</p>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Color Vision Deficiency</h2>
		<p>Color vision deficiency is the inability to distinguish certain shades of color or in more severe cases, see colors at all. The term “color blindness” is also used to describe this visual condition, but very few people are completely color blind.</p>
		<p>What causes color vision deficiency?</p>
		<p>
				<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
					<li>diabetes.</li>
					<li>glaucoma.</li>
					<li>multiple sclerosis.</li>
				</ul>	
		</p>
		<p>How is color vision deficiency treated?</p>
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
					<li>There is no cure for inherited color deficiency. But if the cause is an illness or eye injury, treating these conditions may improve color vision.</li>
					<li>Using special tinted eyeglasses or wearing a red tinted contact lens on one eye can increase some people’s ability to differentiate between colors, though nothing can make you truly see the deficient color.</li>

		<h2 style="font-family:High Tower Text;font-weight:bold;color:#303E3E  ;">Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
		<p>Diabetic retinopathy is a condition occurring in persons with diabetes, which causes progressive damage to the retina, the light sensitive lining at the back of the eye. It is a serious sight-threatening complication of diabetes.</p>
		<p>Diabetes is a disease that interferes with the body’s ability to use and store sugar, which can cause many health problems. Too much sugar in the blood can cause damage throughout the body, including the eyes. Over time, diabetes affects the circulatory system of the retina.

			Diabetic retinopathy is the result of damage to the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina. They leak blood and other fluids that cause swelling of retinal tissue and clouding of vision. The condition usually affects both eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely they will develop diabetic retinopathy. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.</p>
		<p>Symptoms:</p>
		
			<ul style="font-family:Gill Sans MT;font-size:16px;color:#7A8181  ;">
					<li>Seeing spots or floaters in your field of vision.</li>
